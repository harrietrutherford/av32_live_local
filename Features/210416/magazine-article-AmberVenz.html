          <h3 class="subHeading justifiedText">Dallas-based Amber Venz is one seriously smart cookie. The woman behind venzedits.com, is also the co-founder of rewardStyle. Venz describes the business as &ldquo;a monetization and marketing platform for global style publishers and retailers&rdquo; AKA it translates clicks into cash for an influential online community. See, told you she was smart. Despite the huge success of the business (in the past 12 months alone, rewardStyle has opened two new offices, grown from 92 to 150 team members worldwide, signed on a new headquarter space and Venz asked to be a 2016 Featured Keynote at the SXSW Interactive conference) Venz&rsquo;s Texan charm, not to mention that distinctly Dallas sense of impeccable glamour, remain undiluted. We caught up with her during a London pit stop (she visited nearly 40 cities last year alone, phew) to talk online camaraderie, false eyelashes and motherhood.</h3>

            <h3 class="subHeading justifiedText"><strong>On her first fashion love&hellip;</strong><br />
When I was in second grade, I would watch Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen adventure movies to see what they were wearing so I could replicate their looks for school the next day. My entrepreneurial drive was identified early; in fifth grade I was kicked out of class for knitting and selling scarves on the back row of math class.<br />
<br />
<strong>On how motherhood has changed her&hellip; </strong><br />
Since I gave birth to my daughter, Birdie, I &ldquo;don&rsquo;t sweat the small stuff,&rdquo; as my dad has always advised, and I am enjoying much more peace in my life. The boundaries of my lifestyle have allowed me to make time for things that are much more important than work: faith and family.<br />
<br />
<strong>And how it&rsquo;s changed her personal style&hellip;</strong><br />
In my early twenties I loved the oversized style; it was cool, easy and effortless. Since the baby my motto is &ldquo;belt it!&rdquo; as pieces like fur coats and oversized sweaters can make me appear heavier than I am. Now, I pair my favorite items with a super skinny or a wide belt to create a waistline.<br />
<br />
<strong>On the sense of camaraderie in the digital world&hellip;</strong><br />
One of our core values as a company is community. A few years ago, someone came up with the hashtag &lsquo;#rStheFamily&rsquo; to describe our team, and it truly transcends to all sides of our business. It is important to me that we have personal relationships with everyone using our network.<br />
<br />
<strong>On what she loves about the blogosphere&hellip;</strong><br />
Everyone is allowed their own opinion, perspective and voice. There is truly a digital destination for everyone and a style that will resonate with your own personal preferences. Because the audiences built around bloggers are fast growing and authentic, the purchasing power they harness is extremely valuable.</h3>

I absolutely love @StyleHeroine, her outfits are amazing! Some other accounts I follow are: @IreneIsGood @Chufy @AnyaZiourova @OhhCouture @ChriselleLim @Anoukyve @Marianna_Hewitt @QueenOfJetlags @Negin_Mirsalehi<br />

<strong>On technology democratising fashion&hellip;</strong><br />
With the rise of rewardStyle, my generation and those younger than me are more equipped to ideate, generate, create, share and syndicate than any publisher in history. The most rewarding part about what we are doing it empowering thousands of bloggers and content creators around the world to capitalize on their circumstance by providing them with the technology and education to work for themselves.<br />
<br />
<strong>On her business role model&hellip;</strong><br />
Baxter Box, my husband and co-founder. We are really the yin and yang of co-founders, because my experience is solely fashion and his is in technology investments. Where I was lacking, he was excelling. He has truly helped me grow both personally and professionally.<br />
<br />
<strong>On the most treasured pieces in her wardrobe&hellip; </strong><br />
I wear the same diamond bands everyday; each ring represents a milestone in mine and Baxter&rsquo;s relationship. Also, the red Chanel Boy bag that I bought to wear to my first Chanel show, M&eacute;tier in Dallas.<br />
<br />
<strong>On her sartorial guilty pleasure:</strong><br />
Lash extensions. They are a bit Texas, a bit LA and a bit Dubai, but I love wearing them when I get dressed for an event.<br />
<br />
<strong>On some of her favourite Dallas vintage treasure troves&hellip;</strong><br />
I have found some incredible mid-century, &lsquo;Palm Springs chic&rsquo; home pieces at Scout Design; my mom is a regular at Lula Bs (this is for the true vintage hoarder); and Dolly Python is best for Texas souvenirs - they have an incredible selection of cowboy boots and vintage jeans.<br />
<br />
<strong>On the most &lsquo;Texas&rsquo; thing about her&hellip;</strong><br />
I would like to think it is my hospitable nature; Texans are known for that.</h3>
